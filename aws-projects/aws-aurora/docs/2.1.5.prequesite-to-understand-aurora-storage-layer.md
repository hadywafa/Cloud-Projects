# 📚 **How to Understand Aurora’s Storage Layer – Prerequisites & Learning Path**

You're absolutely right! **Aurora’s storage layer is a highly complex distributed system**, and understanding it **requires a solid foundation in multiple areas**.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** on what you should **learn first** before diving deeper into Aurora’s storage internals.

---

## 🏗 **1️⃣ Prerequisites to Understand Aurora’s Storage Architecture**

To truly **grasp how Aurora’s storage system works**, you should have a good understanding of these topics:

### **🔹 1. Distributed Systems Basics**

✔ How **distributed storage works** (e.g., Google Spanner, DynamoDB).  
✔ **CAP Theorem** (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).  
✔ **Quorum-based consensus** (Paxos, Raft).

📌 **Why?**  
Aurora **stores data across multiple AZs (Availability Zones)** and uses **quorum-based replication**.

---

### **🔹 2. Storage Systems & File Systems**

✔ **How traditional databases store data** (EBS, SSDs, HDDs).  
✔ **B-Trees & LSM-Trees** (used in indexing and storage engines).  
✔ **RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks)** and how data is spread across multiple storage devices.

📌 **Why?**  
Aurora **does not use traditional file-based storage** like PostgreSQL/MySQL. Instead, it **distributes data across a shared storage layer**.

---

### **🔹 3. Database Internals**

✔ **How traditional RDBMS handles WAL (Write-Ahead Logs)**.  
✔ **How replication works in PostgreSQL/MySQL** (Streaming Replication, WAL shipping).  
✔ **How transactions are committed** (ACID properties).

📌 **Why?**  
Aurora **replaces WAL logs with a Redo Log** system that writes changes directly to a **shared storage engine**.

---

### **🔹 4. Networking & Cloud Concepts**

✔ **How AWS Availability Zones work**.  
✔ **How network-based storage like Amazon S3 or EFS works**.  
✔ **Basics of cloud storage replication & load balancing**.

📌 **Why?**  
Aurora’s storage layer **is not tied to a single disk**—it is **spread across multiple AZs**, meaning **network speed & cloud-based replication are crucial**.

---

## 🚀 **2️⃣ What Do You Need to Know Right Now About Aurora Architecture?**

Since **Aurora’s storage internals are complex**, you don’t need to master everything immediately. Here’s what’s **most important to understand now**:

### **🔹 1. Aurora’s Compute vs. Storage Separation**

✔ **Aurora decouples the compute (database instances) from storage (distributed layer).**  
✔ **Instances do not store data locally**—they query a **shared storage pool**.  
✔ **This allows instant failover and scaling** without losing data.

---

### **🔹 2. Aurora Uses Quorum-Based Storage Replication**

✔ **Each data block is stored 6 times across 3 AZs.**  
✔ **At least 4 out of 6 storage nodes must confirm a write before it’s committed.**  
✔ This ensures **high availability and fault tolerance**.

---

### **🔹 3. Aurora Replaces WAL with Redo Logs**

✔ **Traditional PostgreSQL/MySQL use WAL (Write-Ahead Logs) for recovery & replication.**  
✔ **Aurora does NOT use WAL logs! Instead, it stores Redo Logs in shared storage.**  
✔ This means **no WAL shipping, lower latency, and faster failovers.**

---

### **🔹 4. Aurora’s Replicas Are Not Copies—They Read the Same Storage Layer**

✔ In **traditional replication**, read replicas have **separate full copies** of the database.  
✔ In **Aurora, replicas just read from the same shared storage**.  
✔ This means **zero replication lag** and **instant failover**.

---

### **🔹 5. Aurora Auto-Scales Storage to 128TiB**

✔ Aurora **automatically increases storage** in **10GB increments** as needed.  
✔ Unlike RDS, **you don’t have to provision storage manually**.  
✔ **Failover is fast because replicas already have access to the latest data.**
